# Organise
This is a C++ version of a file organising tool I made for my parents.

## Getting started
In order to use this, you must compile the source code.
The 'how' of doing this differs from system to system:
- macOS: clang++ organise.cpp -o organise -std=c++17
- Linux: clang++ organise.cpp -o organise -std=c++17 -lstdc++fs

NOTE: If you are trying to use this in windows, you will have to change the delimiter constant from '/' to '\\'.
If you do not do this it will not work.

## To do
In the future I am going to try and make this work on windows.
